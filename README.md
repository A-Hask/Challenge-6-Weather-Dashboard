# Weather-Dashboard
The goal of this project is to display the current and future weather conditions in any city that the user wishes.
<br>
The user can search the name of the desired city and find current weather information and a five day forecast with dates.
<br>
The website also stores and displays previous searches as well as provides a color coded uv index report.
